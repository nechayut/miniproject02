# miniproject02 : Churn prediction
This repository contains an analysis of customer churn using a publicly available customer churn dataset. The dataset includes customer information and churn status, allowing us to explore the factors influencing customer attrition.

The analysis includes the following steps:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We explore the dataset, examine variable distributions, and identify correlations to gain insights into the data.

2.Feature Engineering: We preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3.Modeling: We build machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to predict customer churn based on available features.

4.Evaluation: We assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Feature Importance: We identify the most significant features contributing to customer churn, helping businesses understand key factors influencing customer retention.

The results provide insights into customer churn and help develop effective retention strategies for businesses.
